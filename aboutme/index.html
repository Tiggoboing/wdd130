<p>Hi everyone! I am excited to be taking this class and learning how to design web pages and the fundamentals of design.I help manage a webpage for a local wind ensemble with wix.com, but I know I could do more with the site if I knew the language to design wtih. My career path has already been interesting as a paramedic for 911 for 30 years. I suffered a massive heart attack, cardiac arrest and had double bypass surgery while on shift! The Lord has other plans for me now.</p>
<p>I have two children ages 21 and 12, and have been married for 22 years. My husband is not a member of the church, but he still participates and helps where he is needed. I am a convert to the church since 2012. One of my favorite scriptures is D&C 18:17. I believe it tells you everything that God is giving to us that we need to live.</p>
<p>My nickname Feta came about this summer from Girl Scout camp. As a couselor, I needed a nickname and I like feta cheese because I am a vegetarian, so it stuck! Now as the camp "nurse", I am "Feta" to all the kids and I make everything "betta!"</p>
