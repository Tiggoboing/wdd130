        <h2>Characteristics</h2>
        <p>As the name suggests, the Herkimer diamond resembles the appearance of a diamond. They are transparent and shiny and, although not as hard as a diamond, can scratch the surface of glass. They register a 7-7.5 on the Mohs Hardness Scale, with the most valuable Herkimer diamond being crystal clear. The average size is approximately one inch in length. Due to the unique nature of how they grow, the Herkimer diamond is described as double terminated, which means both ends come to a point. Not all quartz that are double pointed are Herkimer diamonds.</p>
